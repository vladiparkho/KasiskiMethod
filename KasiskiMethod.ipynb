      "Drive — no, looking at the sign; cats couldn’t read\n",

      "that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why, that\n",
      "man had to be older than he was, and wearing an\n",
      "emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it\n",
      "struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly\n",
      "stunt — these people were obviously collecting for\n",
      "something ... yes, that would be it. The traffic moved\n",
      "on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the\n",
      "Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in\n",
      "his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn’t, he might\n",
      "have found it harder to concentrate on drills that\n",
      "morning. He didn’t see the owls swooping past in\n",
      "broad daylight, though people down in the street did;\n",
      "they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after\n",
      "owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an\n",
      "owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a\n",
      "perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five\n",
      "different people. He made several important telephone\n",
      "\n",
      "calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good\n",
      "mood until lunchtime, when he thought he’d stretch\n",

      "bun from the bakery.\n",
      "\n",
      "He’d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he\n",
      "passed a group of them next to the baker’s. He eyed\n",
      "them angrily as he passed. He didn’t know why, but\n",
      "they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering\n",
      "excitedly, too, and he couldn’t see a single collecting\n",
      "tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a\n",

      "He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his\n",

      "seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing\n",
      "his home number when he changed his mind. He put\n",
      "the receiver back down and stroked his mustache,\n",
      "thinking ... no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn’t\n",

      "Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew\n",
      "was called Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It\n",
      "might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no\n",

      "upset at any mention of her sister. He didn’t blame\n",
      "her — if he’d had a sister like that ... but all the\n",
      "same, those people in cloaks ...\n",
      "\n",
      "He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that\n",
      "afternoon and when he left the building at five o’clock,\n",
      "he was still so worried that he walked straight into\n",
      "someone just outside the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sorry,” he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled\n",
      "and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr.\n",
      "Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet\n",
      "cloak. He didn’t seem at all upset at being almost\n",
      "knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split\n",
      "into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that\n",
      "made passersby stare, “Don’t be sorry, my dear sir,\n",
      "for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-\n",

      "rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home,\n",
      "hoping he was imagining things, which he had never\n",

      "imagination.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the\n",
      "first thing he saw — and it didn’t improve his mood —\n",
      "was the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning. It was\n",
      "now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the\n",
      "same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shoo!” said Mr. Dursley loudly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look.\n",
      "\n",
      "Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered.\n",
      "Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the\n",

      "\n",
      "“And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported\n",
      "that the nation’s owls have been behaving very\n",
      "unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at\n",
      "night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have\n",
      "been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in\n",
      "every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to\n",
      "explain why the owls have suddenly changed their\n",

      "“Well, Ted,” said the weatherman, “I don’t know about\n",
      "that, but it’s not only the owls that have been acting\n",
      "oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire,\n",
      "and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that\n",
      "instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they’ve had a\n",
      "downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have\n",

      "lately, have you?”\n",

      "bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "and peered down into the front garden. The cat was\n",
      "still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though\n",
      "it were waiting for something.\n",
      "\n",
      "Was he imagining things? Could all this have\n",

      "asleep was that even if the Potters were involved,\n",
      "there was no reason for them to come near him and\n",
      "Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and\n",
      "Petunia thought about them and their kind. ... He\n",
      "couldn’t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up\n",
      "in anything that might be going on — he yawned and\n",

      "How very wrong he was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy\n",
      "sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no\n",
      "sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue,\n",
      "its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet\n",
      "Drive. It didn’t so much as quiver when a car door\n",
      "slammed on the next street, nor when two owls\n",
      "swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight\n",
      "before the cat moved at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "A man appeared on the corner the cat had been\n",
      "watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you’d\n",
      "have thought he’d just popped out of the ground. The\n",
      "cat’s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet\n",
      "Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the\n",
      "silver of his hair and beard, which were both long\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long\n",
      "robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and\n",
      "high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light,\n",
      "bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles\n",
      "and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it\n",
      "had been broken at least twice. This man’s name was\n",
      "Albus Dumbledore.\n",
      "\n",
      "Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realize that he had\n",
      "just arrived in a street where everything from his\n",
      "name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy\n",
      "rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But\n",
      "he did seem to realize he was being watched, because\n",
      "he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still\n",
      "staring at him from the other end of the street. For\n",
      "some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse\n",
      "him. He chuckled and muttered, “I should have\n",
      "known.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He found what he was looking for in his inside\n",
      "pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He\n",
      "flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it.\n",
      "The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He\n",
      "clicked it again — the next lamp flickered into\n",
      "darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer,\n",
      "until the only lights left on the whole street were two\n",
      "tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of\n",
      "the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their\n",
      "window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they\n",
      "wouldn’t be able to see anything that was happening\n",
      "down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-\n",
      "Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the\n",
      "street toward number four, where he sat down on the\n",
      "wall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but after a\n",
      "moment he spoke to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone.\n",
      "Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking\n",
      "woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the\n",
      "shape of the markings the cat had had around its\n",
      "eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one.\n",
      "Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She\n",
      "looked distinctly ruffled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How did you know it was me?” she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all\n",
      "day,” said Professor McGonagall.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All day? When you could have been celebrating? I\n",
      "must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my\n",
      "way here.”\n",

      "Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh yes, everyone’s celebrating, all right,” she said\n",
      "impatiently. “You’d think they’d be a bit more careful,\n",
      "but no — even the Muggles have noticed something’s\n",
      "going on. It was on their news.” She jerked her head\n",
      "back at the Dursleys’ dark living-room window. “I\n",
      "heard it. Flocks of owls ... shooting stars. ... Well,\n",
      "they’re not completely stupid. They were bound to\n",
      "notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent — I’ll\n",

      "sense.”\n",
      "\n",

      "years.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know that,” said Professor McGonagall irritably.\n",
      "\n",

      "thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who\n",

      "out about us all. I suppose he really has gone,\n",
      "Dumbledore?”\n",
      "\n",

      "“No, thank you,” said Professor McGonagall coldly, as\n",
